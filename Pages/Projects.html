					<h1>Welcome to My Programming Projects</h1>
					<p>This page is a culmination of some of the coding prjects that I have worked on throughout my college career for classes and in my free time some of the projects listed may be private as I am
					trying to revise them as I am a better programmer than when some of them were written</p>
					<h2> <a href="https://github.com/aubrey1990/PythonProject">Plane Project</a></h2>
					<p>This is one of the projects that I have written in Python. The goal of this project was to take in flight data and create a formula that will tell airplane riders 
					 what is the best flight for them to take. In this project I use pandas for the data science and getting the data to look the way I want it 
					 and I use Tkinter to create the UI </p>

					<h2> <a href="https://github.com/aubrey1990/GreenScreen">Green Screen</a></h2>
					<p>In this Project I use java to make a Green Screen. It takes in two images the first is the one that you want 
					to be your green screen and the other is the image you want over it, then I ask the user to give me color ranges for red,blue and green
					and then the program looks at each pixel and asses if the pixel falls with in the range to be over written if it does then the program will 
					overwrite the current pixel on the green screen image with the other image</p>
